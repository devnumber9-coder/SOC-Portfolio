## Attack Simulation

Initial validation of host connectivity was performed using Kali Linux.

Actions performed:
- ICMP ping to Windows host
- Nmap scan to validate host reachability
- Manual failed authentication attempts on Windows

The purpose of this phase was to generate authentication failure telemetry, not exploit services.

Screenshots:
- Kali ping output
- Nmap scan results

This is not a hacking lab — keep it professional.
