# Security Operations & IT Security Portfolio

## About Me

Entry-level IT Security professional building hands-on experience in security monitoring, log analysis, and detection engineering through structured labs aligned with CompTIA Security+ and SOC fundamentals.

This portfolio documents real labs I have completed, how I configured them, what I observed, and what I learned — with screenshots and written analysis for each project.

## Core Skills (Hands-On)

### Security Operations Foundations
- Log collection and normalization
- Security event monitoring
- Detection rule creation
- Basic incident analysis
- Alert vs dashboard-based detection

### Blue Team Fundamentals
- Threat detection concepts
- IOC recognition (IPs, ports, processes)
- Network traffic awareness
- Windows & Linux log analysis
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping (intro level)

## Tools I Have Actually Used

### SIEM & Logging
- Splunk Enterprise (Home Lab)
- Windows Event Logs
- Sysmon (basic configuration)
- Network connection logs (netstat, firewall data)

### Operating Systems & Platforms
- Windows 10 / Windows Server (lab)
- Linux (Ubuntu, Kali – basic usage)
- VirtualBox / VMware

### Networking & Analysis
- TCP/UDP traffic inspection
- Port and process correlation
- Local attack simulation (controlled lab activity)

## Certifications

- **CompTIA Security+** — In Progress
- **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** — Completed

(Future certifications will be added only after completion)

## Completed Lab Projects
