🛡️ Security Operations & IT Security Portfolio
👋 About Me

Entry-level IT Security professional building hands-on experience in security monitoring, log analysis, and detection engineering through structured labs aligned with CompTIA Security+ and SOC fundamentals.

This portfolio documents real labs I have completed, how I configured them, what I observed, and what I learned — with screenshots and written analysis for each project.

🎯 Core Skills (Hands-On)
Security Operations Foundations

Log collection and normalization

Security event monitoring

Detection rule creation

Basic incident analysis

Alert vs dashboard-based detection

Blue Team Fundamentals

Threat detection concepts

IOC recognition (IPs, ports, processes)

Network traffic awareness

Windows & Linux log analysis

MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping (intro level)

🧰 Tools I Have Actually Used
SIEM & Logging

Splunk Enterprise (Home Lab)

Windows Event Logs

Sysmon (basic configuration)

Network connection logs (netstat, firewall data)

Operating Systems & Platforms

Windows 10 / Windows Server (lab)

Linux (Ubuntu, Kali – basic usage)

VirtualBox / VMware

Networking & Analysis

TCP/UDP traffic inspection

Port and process correlation

Local attack simulation (controlled lab activity)

📜 Certifications

CompTIA Security+ — In Progress

Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate — Completed

(Future certifications will be added only after completion)

🔬 Completed & Active Labs
1️⃣ Splunk SIEM Detection Lab (Completed)

Focus: Log ingestion, detection logic, and validation
Status: ✅ Completed

What I Did

Installed and configured Splunk Enterprise

Ingested Windows logs into Splunk

Simulated suspicious network activity

Created searches to identify abnormal behavior

Learned why alerts did not trigger automatically

Validated detections using dashboards instead of alerts

Key Lessons

Alerts require strict conditions and thresholds

Dashboards are better for lab-based validation

Not all malicious activity generates alerts by default

Detection engineering ≠ instant alerts

📁 Documentation included:

Setup steps

Searches used

Screenshots of events

Explanation of why alerts did/did not fire

2️⃣ Network Activity & Port Monitoring Lab (Completed)

Focus: Network behavior analysis
Status: ✅ Completed

What I Did

Monitored live connections using netstat -ano

Correlated open ports with running processes

Generated controlled suspicious connections

Verified activity appeared in Splunk logs

Learned differences between TCP vs UDP visibility

Key Lessons

Some traffic does not generate alerts

Logging ≠ detection

Visibility depends on data sources

3️⃣ SOC Workflow Fundamentals Lab (Active)

Focus: SOC thinking & documentation
Status: 🔄 In Progress

What I’m Doing

Documenting detections like a SOC analyst

Writing investigation notes

Mapping events to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

Practicing “Is this normal or suspicious?” analysis

🧪 Lab Environment

Virtualization: VirtualBox / VMware

SIEM: Splunk Enterprise

Operating Systems: Windows, Linux

Attack Simulation: Controlled local testing only

Networking: Host-only & NAT lab networks

📝 Documentation Standards

Every lab includes:

Objective

Environment setup

Data sources used

Detection logic

Screenshots (evidence)

Analysis & conclusions

What I would improve next time

🎓 Current Learning Focus

CompTIA Security+ (Domains 1–5)

SOC alert logic vs dashboards

Windows logging & Sysmon basics

Entry-level incident response workflows

Preparing for SOC / IT Security interviews
